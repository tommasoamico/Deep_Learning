# Deep_Learning
Repository for the Neural Network and Deep Learning course of the Physics od Data master degreee :computer:

During the course 8 lab lectures were given throughout the semester. For the exam the student needed to deliver 3 homeworks that are here uploaded in this repository.

Below a little shorthand description of each homeworks:

- Homework 1 (Supervised Learning): this homework was set up in 2 separate tasks, in the first one a standard function approximation regression task is performed with additional care put to find the best hyperparameters of the net.
After hat a classification task on the Fashion MNIST dataset is peroformed.

- Homework 2 (Unsupervised Learning): the second homework of the 3 is divided in 3 main parts, the first one is a standard autoencoder working with images, we try to lean an higher level representation of the data. Through PCA, ICA and t-SNE we then try to visualize the latent space.
The second part consists into a fine tuning of the autoencoder in the same supervised task tested in homework 1, trying to make experience in transfer learning.

- Homework 3 (Deep Reinforcement Learning): In the last homework we employ Deep Reinforcment Learning in order to solve 3 different [Gym](http://www.gymlibrary.ml) environments, that is the, [CartPole](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py), the [Acrobot](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/acrobot.py) and the [Mountain Car](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/mountain_car.py).


All of the homeworks descricted above are Jupyter Notebooks with detailed explanation of the code inside of them written in Markdown.
